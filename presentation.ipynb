    "\n",
    "From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_histogram_equalization):\n",
    "\n",
    " * AHE is a computer [image processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_processing) technique used to improve [contrast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contrast_(vision)) in images. \n",
    " * It differs from ordinary [histogram equalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram_equalization) in the respect that the adaptive method computes several [histograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram), each corresponding to a distinct section of the image, and uses them to redistribute the lightness values of the image. \n",
    " * It is therefore suitable for improving the local contract and enhancing the definitions of edges in each region of an image. \n",

    "### FLCLAHE: Fully-localized contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization\n",
    "\n",
    " * CLAHE can product uneven effects in images with very low contrast due to the histograms being re-used for each pixel in a window of pixels.\n",
    " * A more accurately enhanced image can be produced by producing a unique histogram for each pixel in the source image and calculating the cumulative distribution function on a per-pixel basis.\n",
    " * Such an algorithm would require considerable optimaization and tunint to execute in an efficient manner."
